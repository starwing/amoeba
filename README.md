# Amoeba -- the constraint solving algorithm in pure C

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/starwing/amoeba.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/starwing/amoeba)

Amoeba is a pure C implement of Cassowary algorithm.
Amoeba use Clean C, which is the cross set of ANSI C89 and C++, like
the Lua language.

Amoeba is a single-file library, for more single-file library, see the
stb project [here][1].

Amoeba largely impressed by [kiwi][2], the C++ implement of Cassowary
algorithm, and the algorithm [paper][3].

Amoeba ships a hand written Lua binding.

Amoeba has the same license with the [Lua language][4].
